Brevets App

1. Set brevet distance and the starting date and time before anything else.
2. Refresh page if you want to change brevet distance or date/time.
3. Enter Control locations as either miles or kilometers.
4. Click submit when you want to store control open and close times.
5. Click display when you want to see the last set of control times stored.

RESTful API-services

1. Page will ask user:
    - If they want to display the times in CSV or JSON.
    - The number of times they want to display.
    - If they want to list all, open only, or close only times.
2. Once form is summited, the data will be used to redirect to appropriate url.
3. Finally get the list of appropriate control times based on data and mongo database.
